# Netflix Clone Onboarding Screen with Swift & SwiftUI

This project demonstrates how to create a clone of the Netflix onboarding screen using Swift, SwiftUI, and the Lottie package for smooth animations. It's designed to showcase the use of modern iOS development practices, including the use of `SwiftUI` for UI development and `Lottie` for animations.

## Features

- **SwiftUI**: Leverages SwiftUI for a declarative UI programming approach.
- **Lottie Animations**: Integrates Lottie animations for dynamic and engaging UI elements.
- **Customizable**: Easily customizable cards for onboarding screens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 12.0 or later
- iOS 14.0 or later
- Swift 5.0 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-clone-swiftui.git
```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
3. Build and run the project on your device or simulator.
### Usage
The project consists of several key components:

- `Card.swift`: Defines the structure of each onboarding card.
- `CardView.swift`: A SwiftUI view that displays the content of a card.
- `LottieView.swift`: Wraps a Lottie animation view for use in SwiftUI.
- `ContentView.swift`: The root view of the application, managing the onboarding flow.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to learn more about Swift, SwiftUI, and Lottie animations.
